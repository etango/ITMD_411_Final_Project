# ITMD_411_Final_Project
#Developed by Elton Tang

My final project for the class was to develope an executable CRUD application that connects to SQL database to create, read, update, and delete. The results are displayed to the GUI using Java Swing. The application was designed using object orientend programming concepts. 

There error trapping for user to ensure correct data were enter into the the database or requests to prevent the application from crashing. My main approach to this project I focus dividing each task to it's own class so is simple and easier to trouble shoot. 
Through out the project, troubleshooting or debugging was done using System.out.print and catch and try method for errors.
